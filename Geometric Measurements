Perimeter formula---- Length + Width = Perimeter
Ex:1 ---- Find the value of W when the Width is 18yd and the perimeter 56yd?
Since it is a Rectangle, it has 2 equal sides so 18 + 18 = 36.
The perimeter is 56 so you have to subtract 36 form 56 which is 20.
Since there are 2 sides remaining you divide 20 by 2 and get 10.
The length of the rectange is 10yd.
