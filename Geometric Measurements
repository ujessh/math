Perimeter formula---- Length + Width = Perimeter

Ex:1 ---- Find the value of W when the Width is 18yd and the perimeter 56yd?
Since it is a Rectangle, it has 2 equal sides so 18 + 18 = 36.
The perimeter is 56 so you have to subtract 36 form 56 which is 20.
Since there are 2 sides remaining you divide 20 by 2 and get 10.
The length of the rectange is 10yd.

Ex:2 ---- What is the perimeter of the parrallelogram when the width is 6.6 in and the length is 19.3 in?
Since it is a parrallelogram, it also has 2 equal sides so 6.6 + 6.6 is 13.2in and 19.3 + 19.3 = 38.6in.
13.2in+ 38.6in =51.8 in
The perimeter of the parrallogram is 51.8in.
